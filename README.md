# Deep Learning for pytorch dummies

This repository contains some deep learning projects done as part course 50.039 Theory and Practice of Deep Learning: Singapore University of Technology and Design. Feel free to play with them. All the deep learning tasks include the corresponding problem sets.

Feel free to raise any issues and submit pull requests. I gratefully acknowledge all sources that helped me.
